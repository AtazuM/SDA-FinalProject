# Sprint 1
Key points explaining the Sprint 1 Burndown chart:
* We didn't plan our priorities according to the given timeframe
  * Once the "go" was given, we had about 3h for creating the test plan and some test cases, and adding them to the sprint
  * We focused too heavily on creation of the test plan going by the given templates, trying to iron out all the plans for the project
* We misunderstoor the order of operations (as can be seen in the Sprint 1 burndown chart) - it should have been as follows
  * Create test cases in backlog
  * Add them to the sprint
  * Start the sprint
  * Go through the created test cases
* Jira (free version) combined with Xray extenshion (free trial licence) proved to be quite challenging to rapidly performe well in with all of it's sub-menus and overall flow, taking more time for organisational time management and troubleshooting
* Time flows faster then one plans for it to, more "down-to-earth" goal setting is required going forward
