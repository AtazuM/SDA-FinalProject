# Intro
Final project took place during 28th & 29th of August & 4th of September, 2021 as a final part of Software Development Academy's course "Software Tester". Each day consisted of around 5h of working time (including planning, consultations, summaries, breaks)

**Plan:**
* **Day 1:**
  * Introduction to the project:
    * Showcase of tools used
    * Explanation of the plan
  * Test plan creation
  * Creation of the majority of test cases
* **Day 2:**
  * Running of test cases
  * Project documentation on Jira
* **Day 3:**
  * Sprint Review
  * Sprint Retrospective

# Sprint 1
Key points explaining the Sprint 1 Burndown chart:
* We didn't plan our priorities according to the given timeframe
  * Once the "go" was given, we had about 3h for creating the test plan and some test cases, and adding them to the sprint
  * We focused too heavily on creation of the test plan going by the given templates, trying to iron out all the plans for the project
* We misunderstoor the order of operations (as can be seen in the Sprint 1 burndown chart) - it should have been as follows
  * Create test cases in backlog
  * Add them to the sprint
  * Start the sprint
  * Go through the created test cases
* Jira (free version) combined with Xray extenshion (free trial licence) proved to be quite challenging to rapidly performe well in with all of it's sub-menus and overall flow, taking more time for organisational time management and troubleshooting
* Time flows faster then one plans for it to, more "down-to-earth" goal setting is required going forward
* Sprint 1 was closed by our lecturer without prior notice, as the alloted time for the excercise had run out

# Sprint 2
Key points explaining the Sprint 2 Burndown chart:
* As Sprint 1 was closed for us without us being able to run our tests and obtain viable data for next lectures review and retrospective, we chose to work a 1h overtime to be able to execute created test cases
* When opening Spring 2, we scheduled for it to be closed after 5 working days (the night before the review/retrospective lecture) leaving us headroom, to be able to add additional test cases & bug reports during the week

# Conclusions
Main conclusions drawn from the whole test project and both sprints together are as follows:
* Hands-on learning provides the greatest benefit for familiarizing oneself with a new tool/software, but clean and consise guidelines are recommended for best time management and efficiency
* Planning to work overtime right from the start is a recipe for dissapointment
* Open communication and honest critique helps a team stay well aligned and focus on the set end goal
* Initial planning and time allotting is crucial for concise reaching of desired goals and outcomes
* Plan small, deliver big
* Sprint 1 failed, as we spent the Day 1 only on creation of the test plan and had to spend majority of Day 2 writing test cases, left with close to no time for actually running the tests
* Sprint 2 allowed us to run our tests and see their outcomes, yet due to over-ambitious planning to put in extra hours during the evenings - the burndown chart is out of proportion *(also, if we would have added new test cases and ran the test cases during the week after the initial allotted time, the burndown chart would no longer have it's declining active case tendency, thus also disturbing it's flow)
